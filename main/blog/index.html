            <h2>The first post - this website</h2>
            <p>25/06/2016: Rob</p>
            <p>This website was hand crafted by <a href="https://twitter.com/robchamberspfc">me</a> as a way to share pictures and video with friends and family as Hannah was uncomfortable with the idea of these being shared via social media.</p>
            <p>Whilst professionally I work making websites I leave the coding to the experts, so for me it was an opportunity to try and see what I could actually do myself.</p>
            <h3>The geeky(ish) bit</h3>
            <p>This site was written from scratch by me (with some help in places from colleagues) on my Chromebook using <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, a cloud based IDE. The code is stored in <a href="https://github.com/about">github</a> and the site is hosted on github pages</p>
            <p>The picture and video pages use the github API to populate the page with all the image/videos in a particular directory. I explored using a more secure storage facility for the content but getting this working exceeded what I was able to achieve with my setup.</p>
            <p>I was keen to add some security to the site, but wanted to make this proportional. Currently, all of the content and code is publicly available to anyone who was inclined to dig into my github account. However to add some barriers to accessing the site I added an encrypted homepage which upon entering the password redirects you to the actual content. If you can guess these URLs or bookmark them, you can get to the site itself without this password, but this page stops easy access.</p>
            <p>As an extra small safeguard the site requests that it not be indexed by search engines.</p>
            <h3>Coding on a Chromebook</h3>
            <p>As I was writing this I was reflecting on how I had found coding on my Chromebook and decided to add my thoughts here:</p>
            <p>For the most part this worked well and I am really pleased with how the site has turned out. With that said there where definite limitations with the combination of trying to learn a lot of this for the first time and working in the cloud. So many of the guides, answers to questions and helpful information out there is not targeted at people working in this way and it means that there is an additional layer of complexity to anything you try to do.</p>
            <p>There were a number of occasions where I reached dead ends where seemingly simple things became extremely difficult and quickly exceeded my ability and knowledge. I am sure that anyone with more experience could have worked round many of these issues and I think that if I look to do morein the future I will need to look to have a setup that is much closer to what everyone expects beginners to use!</p>
