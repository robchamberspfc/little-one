            <h2>Bertilicious</h2>
              <h3>23/09/2016: Rob</h3>
              <p>I knew when I added this blog to the site that it was unlikely to be updated, however I thought Hannah might a least contribute a token entry in the first couple of months! Still in the spirit of token efforts, here is a quick update.&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Time flies</h3>
              <p>So another month gone with&nbsp;Bertie reaching the&nbsp;two months mark earlier this week. The little one&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="http://chambersbristol.co.uk/main/dashboard/index.html">growing well</a>&nbsp;and is now up to 11lb 7oz. He has also had his first set of jabs so spent a few days feeling a little sorry for himself - but then I guess you can't blame him. Already seems strange looking back at old pics and how much he has changed - guess that will only get more so though!</p>
              <h3>Month of smiles</h3>
              <p>Aside from Bertie piling on the ounces this month will be remembered as when he started breaking out the smiles and also, more recently, admiring his own reflection.</p>
              <p><img class="inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robchamberspfc/little-one/master/content/images/IMG-20160922-WA0001.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1600" /></p>
              <p>It is a lovely&nbsp;milestone and they really do soften the blow of the lack of sleep. Strange what tickles him and how this changes from day to day, unfortunately the same trick never seems to work twice.</p>
              <h3>Party time</h3>
              <p>Last weekend we had a 'say hello to Bertie party' to introduce him to family and friends back in Pompey. Although we (unsurprisingly I'm sure to anyone who knows me ;-p) won't be getting Bertie christened/dripped on/baptised we did want to do something to welcome him to the world.</p>
              <p>This obviously meant bundling him into the car for the two hour drive and hoping he would sleep, which to be fair he did. Well, mostly, until an accident on the M27 caused us to grind to a halt, whereupon his Bertiness expressed his displeasure - for the rest of the drive.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The day itself was brilliant and thanks to everyone who came along. It was great to see you all and Bertie, for the most part, stayed in 'guest mode' and was brilliant. Special thanks to both sets of Grandparents for their help organising.</p>
              <p>Bertie was a bit more of a pickle on the way back and decided to stay awake - we are blaming Nanny Sleeps for this...</p>
              <p>Hoping to put together an album on here of the day, so if you happened to take any pics, we would love a copy, however you can get them to us. Possibly the best bet is via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:robchamberspfc@hotmail.com,hannahmillen@live.co.uk">email</a>.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Anyway, going to go for a nap before the beast awakens for his bottle feed. Thanks for reading and stay tuned, the next post might be written by Hannah, and gramatically correct...</p>

          <h2>A month of Bertie</h2>
          <h3>20/08/2016: Rob</h3>
          <p>As I write this I am currently sat on the sofa with a sleepy Bertie on my chest whilst Hannah gets some sleep. This has become a bit of a routine for us (me giving Bertie his last feed of the day) - or at least as close to one as we have at the moment!</p>
          <img class = "inline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robchamberspfc/little-one/master/main/blog/IMG_20160820_231357.jpg">
           <h3>It's a boy</h3>
          <p>On the 20 July 2016 we finally got to share with all our friends and family the news that our little one was a boy. Not sure how we managed to keep it from everyone for 21 weeks!</p>
          <p>We had names picked for a long time, both for a boy and a girl, way before we were even really thinking of having a little one - even so it is hard to decide "that is the one". Thankfully he seems to have settled nicely into the name Bertie!</p>
          <p>Might try to write a separate post about Bertie's name.</p>
          <h3>The first week</h3>
          <p>Bertie spent the best part of his first week in hospital whilst he and Hannah had a course of antibiotics. It also meant he spent this time with a cannula in his hand and a sock over it, which made leaning to change him a bit more difficult!</p>
          <p>They both left hospital on the 26 July and we did the standard scary drive home - at one point using my phone camera to make sure he was ok as we couldn't see him in his seat.</p>
          <h3>What does he want?</h3>
          <p>The last few weeks, and I am guessing probably for the next year at least, we have been playing the 'what does Bertie want' game. You would think it would be pretty easy given the fairly small list of needs in his life, but that would be wrong and he lets us know when something is not right in his world!</p>
          <p>Interspersed with the blur of naps, feeds and nappies has been lots of lovely visits and deliveries of presents and cards! Thanks to everyone we haven't had a chance to in person yet.</p>
          <p>Bertie seems to delight in making us worry and his preference for causing us to jump out of bed is a cacophony of weird and wonderful noises a night - most of which sound like he is choking. Not good on a sleep addled brain at 3am...</p>
          <h3>23:18 20/08/2016</h3>
          <p>So the time is ticking around to Bertie being exactly a month old and as this is when I am planning to post this I will wrap this ramble up. Despite the weird noises Bertie is doing well and growing all the time. And despite the lack of sleep I love having this little cutie around. :-)</p>
          <p>Do fancy a few beers though...</p>

            <h2>The first post - this website</h2>
            <h3>25/06/2016: Rob</h3>
            <p>This website was hand crafted by <a href="https://twitter.com/robchamberspfc">me</a> as a way to share pictures and video with friends and family as Hannah was uncomfortable with the idea of these being shared via social media.</p>
            <p>Whilst professionally I work making websites I leave the coding to the experts, so for me it was an opportunity to try and see what I could actually do myself.</p>
            <h3>The geeky(ish) bit</h3>
            <p>This site was written from scratch by me (with some help in places from colleagues) on my Chromebook using <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, a cloud based IDE. The code is stored in <a href="https://github.com/about">github</a> and the site is hosted on github pages.</p>
            <p>The picture and video pages use the github API to populate the page with all the image/videos in a particular directory. I explored using a more secure storage facility for the content but getting this working exceeded what I was able to achieve with my setup.</p>
            <p>I was keen to add some security to the site, but wanted to make this proportional. Currently, all of the content and code is publicly available to anyone who was inclined to dig into my github account. However to add some barriers to accessing the site I added an encrypted homepage which upon entering the password redirects you to the actual content. If you can guess these URLs or bookmark them, you can get to the site itself without this password, but this page stops easy access.</p>
            <p>As an extra small safeguard the site requests that it not be indexed by search engines.</p>
            <h3>Coding on a Chromebook</h3>
            <p>As I was writing this I was reflecting on how I had found coding on my Chromebook and decided to add my thoughts here:</p>
            <p>For the most part this worked well and I am really pleased with how the site has turned out. With that said there were definite limitations with the combination of trying to learn a lot of this for the first time and working in the cloud. So many of the guides, answers to questions and helpful information out there is not targeted at people working in this way and it means that there is an additional layer of complexity to anything you try to do.</p>
            <p>There were a number of occasions where I reached dead ends and seemingly simple things became extremely difficult and quickly exceeded my ability and knowledge. I am sure that anyone with more experience could have worked round many of these issues and I think that if I look to do more in the future I will need to look to have a setup that is much closer to what everyone expects beginners to use!</p>
